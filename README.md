# How to use:
CS_Vision in an interactive model building application for computer science concepts (Binary Trees, Graph Theory, Digital Electronics, and Programming Flowcharts). Each panel uses Draggable nodes, and connecting lines to create various structures, and perform calculations woth these structures. Upon first launchin the application the user will begin on the "Binary tree" panel, and have access to the other three panels through the "Actions Menu". The rest of this guide will outline each panel, and its functionality.

## Binary Tree Panel:
this is the panel that is opened on launch of the program. The actions menu in this panel has the following options:
