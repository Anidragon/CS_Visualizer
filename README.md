- Refer to documentation version history and user guide
  
# How to use:
CS_Vision in an interactive model building application for computer science concepts (Binary Trees, Graph Theory, Digital Electronics, and Programming Flowcharts). Each panel uses Draggable nodes, and connecting lines to create various structures, and perform calculations woth these structures. Upon first launchin the application the user will begin on the "Binary tree" panel, and have access to the other three panels through the "Actions Menu". The rest of this guide will outline each panel, and its functionality.

## Binary Tree Panel:
this is the panel that is opened on launch of the program. The actions menu in this panel has the following options:

### Options:
- the first three options will allow the user to navigate to the other panels
- the help option will open a window which outlines how to use the Binary Tree Panel
- the Add new node option will allow the user to generate a new node onto the screen. After selecting the option, the user will be prompted to enter a name for the new node, and generates a Binary Tree node on the screen once name is selected. ex:

- the Change display option will allow the user to select a new display type for the nodes. There are three displays: name, value, and level. A node with a name display will display the its name in front of the node, a node with value display will display the set value of a node(default is 0), a node with level display will display its depth within the tree(the root is 0, its children are 1, etc.) ex:

- the Organize Binary Tree option will organize the tree in decreasing-depth order. This option is helpful if the nodes in the tree have been misplaced by dragging ex:
